# Positioning Practice

This projects demonstrates basic HTML and CSS layout techniques including:

- Responsive two-column layout
- Centered content using `text-align` and `margin: auto`
- Embedded images with descriptive alt text
- Social media icons using Font Awesome

Originally created during my time in Year Up, this project has been revisited and cleaned up for better structure, accessibility, and validation compliance.
